# Material Design Doc
#### A Style Guide implementing Angular Material.

[Angular Material](https://material.angularjs.org/#/) is a UI Framework, built for [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/), and implements Google's [Material Design](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) system. This site is a [Style Guide](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/style-guides/), or a living documentation, that explains how and why components are used within a design system.



Note from the autor:
This website was build primarily to experiment and play with Angular Material and [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/).
